# software-demo

This repo is a skeleton for creating a github pages project to release CBIO-developed software.

It uses the [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) feature


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/uct-cbio/software-demo/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.


### Theme
 
 This site uses a slightly modified version of the *"[minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal)"* Jekyll Theme (hints for customisation there)

  - Layout can be tweaked by editing _layout/default.html


----


### Markdown examples:

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/uct-cbio/software-demo/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
